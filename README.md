# PTD Fitness Demo - AI Video Ad Generator

This is an AI-powered video advertising platform for PTD Fitness, deployed on Firebase.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1Nm2qVbh_UivmW6yOFPYo6X9k0CEChDV9

## 🚀 How to start the Titan Engine (New Backend)

```bash
uvicorn backend_core.main:app --reload
```

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (deployed to Firebase Hosting)
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js + Express + Firestore)
- **AI**: Google Gemini API for video analysis and creative generation
- **Database**: Firestore (replacing better-sqlite3)

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js, Firebase CLI (optional)

### Frontend Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend Development

1. Navigate to functions directory:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Deploy to Firebase

**Prerequisites:** Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)

1. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

2. Deploy hosting and functions:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

   Or deploy separately:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

3. Set environment variables for Cloud Functions:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:config:set gemini.api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
   ```
